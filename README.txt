Usage:

python3 parking.py [generations population_size optimization_params gene_size mutation_rate] [seed]

You can run parking.py without any flags. This will run the program with the recommended parameters from the project
writeup. Otherwise, you will need to specify all parameters even if you wanted to only specify one.

Additionally, there is a seed that can be set. This seed with give make the results of the algorithm consistent and
easy to verify problems with the code.

When the code is finishing, there will be multiple plots that are generated. They will be shown in a pop-up window,
and they will be saved as png file in the working directory.
